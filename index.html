        <h1>Exposing the Truth in Luxury Since 2020</h1>
        <p>The Wolfe Report was founded during the COVID-19 pandemic when greedy retailers took advantage of consumers. Our mission is to provide high-end buyers with <strong>honest, unbiased insights</strong> into luxury cars, watches, real estate, and more.</p>
        <p>We go <strong>undercover</strong> to experience customer service firsthand, revealing how businesses treat their clients based on <strong>who they are—not just what they look like.</strong></p>
        <h2>What We Review</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Luxury Cars (Porsche, Rolex, etc.)</li>
            <li>High-End Watches</li>
            <li>Real Estate & Home Builders</li>
            <li>Tech & Collectibles</li>
            <li>Sales Tactics & Consumer Advocacy</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Generational Sales Program</h2>
        <p>We test the buying experience and the sales tactics used in various industries, exposing deceptive practices and teaching consumers how to overcome them.</p>
        <p>Introducing the <strong>Generational Sales Program</strong>: a patented, transparent sales method that propelled me to the top sales agent in the country in the roofing business. I started my sales career at Best Buy, Circuit City, Guitar Center, and Collections before moving into General Contracting. Unlike many sales reps, I got my roots in manual labor at 13 and learned customer service through growing up in poverty—understanding firsthand how people should be treated in every sale.</p>
        <p><strong>My best sale?</strong> A referral from the smallest project I had ever signed in the roofing business.</p>
        <h2>Custom Sales Workflow Systems</h2>
        <p>As a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> for Custom Sales Workflow Systems, owned by <strong>Renewed Solutions</strong>, we take the management out of the manager. We install <strong>AI-learned sales methods</strong> to make Sales Reps more efficient while teaching them to <strong>truly serve the customer.</strong></p>
        <p>Our systems revolutionize sales training and CRM workflows, automating tasks and enhancing rep performance.</p>
